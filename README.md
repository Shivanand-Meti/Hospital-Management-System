 This is a simple UI for the Hospital Management System. In this project the admin controls the most part of the day to day activities of a hospital
 so he has been given the control of the whole website. 
 
 1.Admin can add the doctors and delete them whenever requireed. He has access to all the patient details.
 
 2.Doctor can view the number of appointments he has for a particular day and comment on the status of each case he has been assigned.
 
 3.Patient has to register himself before making any appointment. Patient has the freedom to choose the the doctors from the list.
